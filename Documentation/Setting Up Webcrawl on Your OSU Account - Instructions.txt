Guide to setting up webcrawler package on your account

1. Enter your Oregon State account through PuTTY or something equivalent. In a folder of your choosing, create
   a Python virtual environment with the following command "virtualenv name_of_environment" where 
   name_of_environment is chosen by you.

2. cd into the environment with "cd name_of_enviornment/bin"

3. Activate the environment with "source activate.csh"

4. Upgrade the setup tools with the command "pip install setuptools --upgrade"

5. Install scrapy with the command "pip install scrapy"

6. You can now deactivate the environment with the command "deactivate"

7. Open up a code editor tool to edit the webcrawl.html file. On line 59, change the "~konturf" part of the form
   action so that it corresponds to your OSU account alias. Save it in a separate place on your computer from 
   the Github files so that it doesn't get overwritten on a fetch.

8. In the webcrawlProg.py file, make the following changes:
	a. On lines 1 and 5, change the file path so that "nfs/stak/users/konturf/CS467/bin" corresponds to the 
           path for the virtual environment you created.
        b. On line 21, change the "~konturf" part of the URL to correspond to your OSU account alias.
        c. Save the file in a separate place on your computer from the Github files so that it doesn't get
           overwritten on a fetch.

9. Open up a file transfer tool such as FileZilla.

10. Transfer the webcrawl.html and visualizer-svg-test-2.php files to your public_html folder. Make sure that both
    files are given 755 file permissions.

11. If there is not one already, create a folder in your public_html folder named "cgi-bin".

12. Transfer the webcrawlProg.py and crawler.py files to the cgi-bin folder. Make sure that both files are given
    755 file permissions.

13. In PuTTY, go to the cgi-bin folder and open webcrawlProg.py with "vim webcrawlProg.py". If, on the bottom of
    the screen, you see [dos], then type ":set ff=unix". Do the same thing with the crawler.py file.

14. Go to http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~your_account_alias/webcrawl.html where your_account_alias should be
    your OSU account alias. You should see the form for entering the webcrawl data. You should be able to enter
    the data and see the results of the webcrawl.
